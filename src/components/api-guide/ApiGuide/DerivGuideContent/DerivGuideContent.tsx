            The Deriv API allows you to perform nearly all functions of the
            Deriv platforms, since they share the same API. For our CFD
            platforms (Deriv MT5 and Deriv X), the API functionality is only
            available for some account management actions.
          </p>

            Technical specifications of the Deriv API
          </h2>
          <p>
            It is only possible to communicate with the Deriv API using
            WebSockets; it does not support other protocols. Any data passed to
            the Deriv API should be in JSON format, while the comprehensive
            all-in-one client library is available in JavaScript and Python.
          </p>
          <h3 id="websockets">WebSockets</h3>
          <p>
            The WebSockets protocol is an advanced version of the communication
            channel that is available in all popular programming languages. It
            allows the server to send information to the client and maintain the
            connection without the client requesting it every time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In comparison, APIs using REST over HTTP don't maintain a connection
            to the client once the server has replied to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The WebSockets protocol provides clients with a faster and more
            efficient way to receive updated information as soon as it becomes
            available. For example, you can subscribe to account balance updates
            and the Deriv servers will send the new balance to your client in
            real time.
          </p>
          <p>
            A client can also subscribe and receive several types of different
            information simultaneously over a single connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            For more information on how to write a client using WebSockets,
            visit this <a href="/docs/">guide</a>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="json">JSON</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data format based on
            JavaScript. However, it is completely language-independent, and can
            be used by any modern programming language. JSON has a good balance
            between being readable by humans and by machines, making it both
            user-friendly and computer-efficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of the JSON formatted code, where “ticks” is the
            name of the attribute and “R_100” is the value of that attribute.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={styles.apiCodeBlock}>
          <CodeBlockSingleLanguage lang="json" content={tickContent} />
        </div>
        <p>
          Data in JSON can also be nested, so if you wanted to send user
          information with an address, it could look like:
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiCodeBlock}>
          <CodeBlockSingleLanguage lang="json" content={nestedContent} />
        </div>
        <p>
          When you are writing an API client, you will write something like{" "}
          <code className="inline-code">print address.street_number </code>
          (depending on the programming language) to print the street number.
        </p>
        <p>
          This nesting can have as many levels as required to convey the
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when we send information about account status, it
          requires several levels to print information (
          <code className="inline-code">
            print authentication.identity.services.manual
          </code>
          ) about the manual Identity service status:
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiCodeBlock}>
          <CodeBlockSingleLanguage lang="json" content={statusContent} />
        </div>
        <h2 id="json-schemas">JSON Schemas</h2>
        <p>
          JSON Schema is a defined format for the JSON messages used to describe
          their structure to Deriv API users. In a nutshell, it’s a standardised
          way of explaining what a JSON request should look like using JSON
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is an example of the part of the JSON Schema that is used to tell
          developers what to send when they request the balance of an account:
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiCodeBlock}>
          <CodeBlockSingleLanguage lang="json" content={schemaContent} />
        </div>
        <p>
          You can see that the balance is a required attribute, the value must
          equal 1, and the account is an optional attribute. But if you choose
          to send it, it must be a string (word) and has to match the described
          pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          JSON Schemas on Deriv are divided into schemas we accept (request) and
          schemas we send (response). You can find the detailed JSON schemas for
          each API call on our <a href="/api-explorer/">API Explorer</a>.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiGuideImage}>
          <img src={apiPlaygroundUrl} alt="API Guide" loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>
          To see the raw JSON schemas, click on the braces within each call.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiGuideImage}>
          <img src={showJSONSchemaUrl} alt="API Guide" loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The JSON Schema also forms the documentation for the API Explorer.
        </p>
        <h2 id="authorisation">Authorisation</h2>
        <p>
          Third-party developers can authorise calls to the API in two different
          ways: via API token or via OAuth2.
        </p>
        <h3>API token</h3>
        <p>
          An API token is a unique identifier of a client that requests access
          from a server. It's the simplest way of authorisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Deriv API token has to be generated by a client{" "}
          <a href="https://app.deriv.com/account/api-token">here</a>, along with
          setting the appropriate access level.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiGuideImage}>
          <img src={apiTokenPageUrl} alt="API Guide" loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>
          The access level for each API token has to match the required access
          level of each API call, which can be found in the{" "}
          <Link to="/api-explorer">API Explorer</Link> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, on the screenshot below, you can see that to be able to
          use the Account Status, a token with read access level must be used.
        </p>
        <div className={styles.apiGuideImage}>
          <img src={readAccessUrl} alt="API Guide" loading="lazy" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Following the authorisation of a WebSocket connection, subsequent
          calls on that connection will be considered user actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please bear in mind that the API token can be used with any app, so
          both your app and your clients need to keep it secure.
        </p>
        <h3>OAuth2</h3>
        <p>
          OAuth stands for Open Authorisation - a protocol that allows a client
          access resources hosted on a server on behalf of the user without
          revealing the credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of authorisation allows clients to log in to third-party
          apps using their Deriv accounts without creating an API token. In this
          case, the third-party app does not see the user's password or
          permanent API token, which makes it safer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The OAuth2 authentication requires more steps to set up, but it is the
          safest way for developers to share access to their app with their
          clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information on OAuth2, visit{" "}
          <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/">this guide</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the visual representation of how the OAuth authorisation
          connection works:

        <p>
          Once a user signs up, they will be redirected to the URL that you
          entered as the Redirect URL. This URL will have arguments added to it
          with the user's session tokens, and will look similar to this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code className="inline-code">
            https://mywebsite.com/redirect/?acct1=cr799393&

          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the parameters of the URL you will see all the accounts and the
          session token for each account.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pass these tokens to the Authorize API call in order to perform
            actions on behalf of the account.
