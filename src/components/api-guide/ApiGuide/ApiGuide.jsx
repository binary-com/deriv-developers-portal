                    <p>
                        API stands for Application Programming Interface - a software that allows 2 or more computer
                        programs to communicate with each other. These 2 programs are usually referred to as server and
                        client.

                            <p>
                                A server contains information required by a client, can grant access to this
                                information, and performs actions with it.
                            </p>

                                {' '}
                                The server defines how it should be spoken to, what actions it will perform, what
                                information it will give, and its format.{' '}

                                All these details are usually determined in an API specification. For example, here is

                                A client is a software program that talks to the server to either obtain information or
                                ask the server to perform certain actions.{' '}

                                Clients can be written in any programming language as long as that language can
                                implement the communication standards specified by the server.{' '}

                                The communication between a server and a client happens with the help of API requests,
                                also known as API calls. The API calls are sent from a client to a server and back. The
                                client and server can be written in different programming languages.{' '}

                        {' '}
                        Client libraries are pre-written pieces of code that can be used to send API calls instead of
                        writing codes from scratch.{' '}

                        {' '}
                        Using a client library is optional but highly recommended, as it makes it much easier and
                        efficient to start working with the API.{' '}
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        {' '}
                        For example, configuring the correct protocol to talk to the server may require several steps
                        without the client library, but using a ready-made code can shorten the process to just one
                        step.{' '}

                        {' '}
                        A client library also makes it easier to adapt to API updates. In many cases, if the API has a
                        significant update, the client library is updated too. The developer of the client that uses API
                        wonâ€™t need to make any changes to their code and will just need to update the version of the
                        client library.{' '}
