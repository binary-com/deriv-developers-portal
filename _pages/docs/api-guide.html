    <h3 id='what-is-api' class="app-registration-header has-navigation">What is API?</h3>
    <p class="short-margin">API stands for Application Programming Interface – a software that allows 2 or more computer
      programs to
      communicate with each other. These 2 programs are usually referred to as server and client.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Server</span>
        <p class="short-margin">A server contains information required by a client, can grant access to this
          information, and performs
          actions with it.</p>
        <p class="short-margin">The server defines how it should be spoken to, what actions it will perform, what
          information it will give,
          and its format.</p>
        <p class="short-margin">All these details are usually determined in an API specification. For example, here is
          the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api">API specification for Twitter</a>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Client</span>
        <p class="short-margin">A client is a software program that talks to the server to either obtain information or
          ask the server to
          perform certain actions.</p>
        <p class="short-margin">Clients can be written in any programming language as long as that language can
          implement the communication
          standards specified by the server. </p>
        <p class="short-margin">The communication between a server and a client happens with the help of API requests,
          also known as API
          calls. The API calls are sent from a client to a server and back. The client and server can be written in
          different programming languages.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is a representation of how an API works:</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/how-api-works.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="how api works" />
    </div>

    <h4>Client libraries</h4>
    <p class="short-margin">Client libraries are pre-written pieces of code that can be used to send API calls instead
      of writing codes from
      scratch.</p>
    <p class="short-margin">Using a client library is optional but highly recommended, as it makes it much easier and
      efficient to start
      working with the API.</p>
    <p class="short-margin">For example, configuring the correct protocol to talk to the server may require several
      steps without the client
      library, but using a ready-made code can shorten the process to just one step.</p>
    <p class="short-margin">A client library also makes it easier to adapt to API updates. In many cases, if the API has
      a significant
      update, the client library is updated too. The developer of the client that uses API won’t need to make any
      changes to their code and will just need to update the version of the client library.</p>

    <h3 id='what-can-you-do-with-the-deriv-api' class="api-sub-title2 bold has-navigation navigation-subtitle">What can you do with the Deriv API?</h3>
    <p class="short-margin">The Deriv API allows you to perform nearly all functions of the Deriv platforms, since they
      share the same API.
      For our CFD platforms (Deriv MT5 and Deriv X), the API functionality is only available for some account management
      actions.</p>
    <p class="short-margin">Our API users typically perform the following activities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Build websites similar to Deriv but with different features.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Create desktop apps to execute trades for themselves and their clients.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Explore historical tick information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Automate services as payment agents.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id='how-can-you-earn-with-deriv-api' class="api-sub-title bold has-navigation navigation-subtitle">How can you earn with Deriv API?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">You can earn commission on trades and payments your clients perform via the
          websites and apps you
          create with Deriv API. Get more details about the commission plans <a href="https://deriv.com/partners/affiliate-ib/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">You can also earn from markups on every contract purchased via a trading app you created
          with Deriv API. The
          markup is defined by you and can be up to 5%.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="short-margin">Here is an example of how the markup is calculated:</p>
    <div class="qute-left">
      <p>To get a payout of <b>2 USD:</b></p>
      <p>Client stake without markup = <b>1.07 USD</b></p>
      <p>With the markup (e.g. 2%), a client pays:</p>
      <p>Client’s stake with the markup = Stake + (payout x markup)</p>
      <p>Client’s stake with the markup = 1.07 USD (2 USD x 2%) = <b>1.11 USD</b></p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="technical-specifications-of-the-deriv-api" class="doc-sub-title has-navigation">Technical specifications of the Deriv API</h2>
    <p>It is only possible to communicate with the Deriv API using WebSockets; it does not support other protocols. Any
      data passed to the Deriv API should be in JSON format, while the comprehensive all-in-one client library is
      available in JavaScript and Python.</p>

    <h3 id="websockets" class="has-navigation navigation-subtitle">WebSockets</h3>

    <p>The WebSockets protocol is an advanced version of the communication channel that is available in all popular
      programming languages. It allows the server to send information to the client and maintain the connection without
      the client requesting it every time.</p>
    <p>In comparison, APIs using REST over HTTP don’t maintain a connection to the client once the server has replied to
      it.</p>
    <p>The WebSockets protocol provides clients with a faster and more efficient way to receive updated information as
      soon as it becomes available. For example, you can subscribe to account balance updates and the Deriv servers will
      send the new balance to your client in real time.</p>
    <p>A client can also subscribe and receive several types of different information simultaneously over a single
      connection.</p>
    <p>For more information on how to write a client using WebSockets, visit this <a href="{{ branch }}/docs/">guide</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="json" class="has-navigation navigation-subtitle">JSON</h3>
    <p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a data format based on JavaScript. However, it is completely
      language-independent, and can be used by any modern programming language. JSON has a good balance between being
      readable by humans and by machines, making it both user-friendly and computer-efficient.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of the JSON formatted code, where “ticks” is the name of the attribute and “R_100” is the
      value of that attribute.</p>

    <div class="center">
      <div class="card card-small">
        <div class="card-header code-card-header">
          <div class="copy-button">
            <img class="copy-button-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/copy.svg" width="16" height="16"
              alt="copy code icon" />
            Copy
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="language-demos">
          <pre data-ticks="json">{% include api-guide/ticks.json %}</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Data in JSON can also be nested, so if you wanted to send user information with an address, it could look like:
    </p>

    <div class="center">
      <div class="card card-small">
        <div class="card-header code-card-header">
          <div class="copy-button">
            <img class="copy-button-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/copy.svg" width="16" height="16"
              alt="copy code icon" />
            Copy
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="language-demos">
          <pre data-user-information="json">{% include api-guide/user-information.json %}</pre>
        </div>1
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>When you are writing an API client, you will write something like <code>print address.street_number</code>
      (depending on the programming language) to print the street number.</p>

    <p>This nesting can have as many levels as required to convey the information.</p>
    <p>For example, when we send information about account status, it requires several levels to print information about
      the manual Identity service status:</p>

    <div class="center">
      <div class="card card-small">
        <div class="card-header code-card-header">
          <div class="copy-button">
            <img class="copy-button-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/copy.svg" width="16" height="16"
              alt="copy code icon" />
            Copy
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="language-demos">
          <pre data-account-status="json">{% include api-guide/account-status.json %}</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 id="json-schemas" class="has-navigation navigation-subtitle">JSON Schemas</h3>
    <p>JSON Schema is a defined format for the JSON messages used to describe their structure to Deriv API users. In a
      nutshell, it’s a standardised way of explaining what a JSON request should look like using JSON itself.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of the part of the JSON Schema that is used to tell developers what to send when they request
      the balance of an account:</p>

    <div class="center">
      <div class="card card-small">3 
        <div class="card-header code-card-header">
          <div class="copy-button">
            <img class="copy-button-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/copy.svg" width="16" height="16"
              alt="copy code icon" />
            Copy
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="language-demos">
          <pre data-balance="json">{% include api-guide/balance.json %}</pre>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You can see that the balance is a required attribute, the value must equal 1, and the account is an optional
      attribute. But if you choose to send it, it must be a string (word) and has to match the described pattern.</p>

    <p>JSON Schemas on Deriv are divided into schemas we accept (request) and schemas we send (response). You can find
      the detailed JSON schemas for each API call on our <a href="{{ branch }}/api-explorer/">API Explorer</a>.</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/api-playground.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="api explorer" />
    </div>
    <p>To see the raw JSON schemas, click on the braces within each call.</p>
    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/show-json-schema.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="show json schema" />
    </div>
    <p>The JSON Schema also forms the documentation for the API Explorer.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-block">
    <h2 id="authorisation" class="doc-sub-title has-navigation navigation-subtitle">Authorisation</h2>
    <p>Third-party developers can authorise calls to the API in two different ways: via API token or via OAuth2.</p>
    <h4>API token</h4>
    <p>An API token is a unique identifier of a client that requests access from a server. It’s the simplest way of
      authorisation.</p>
    <p>The Deriv API token has to be generated by a client <a href="https://app.deriv.com/account/api-token">here</a>, along with setting the appropriate access level.
    </p>


    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/api-token-page.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="api token page" />
    </div>

    <p>The access level for each API token has to match the required access level of each API call, which can be found
      in the <a href="{{ branch }}/api-explorer/">API Explorer</a> as well. </p>
    <p>For example, on the screenshot below, you can see that to be able to use the Account Status, a token with read
      access level must be used. </p>

    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/read-access.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="read access api" />
    </div>

    <p>Following the authorisation of a WebSocket connection, subsequent calls on that connection will be considered
      user actions.</p>
    <p>Please bear in mind that the API token can be used with any app, so both your app and your clients need to keep
      it secure.</p>


    <h4>OAuth2</h4>

    <p>OAuth stands for Open Authorisation – a protocol that allows a client access resources hosted on a server on
      behalf of the user without revealing the credentials.</p>
    <p>This type of authorisation allows clients to log in to third-party apps using their Deriv accounts without
      creating an API token. In this case, the third-party app does not see the user's password or permanent API token,
      which makes it safer.</p>
    <p>The OAuth2 authentication requires more steps to set up, but it is the safest way for developers to share access
      to their app with their clients.</p>
    <p>For more information on OAuth2, visit <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/">this guide</a>.</p>
    <p>Here is the visual representation of how the OAuth authorisation connection works:</p>

    <div class="center">
      <img class="api-guide-image" src="{{ branch }}/img/how-oauth-works.png" width="70%" height="auto" alt="how oauth works" />

    <h2 class="doc-sub-title">What do you need to do to use OAuth authorisation for Deriv API?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Specify the URL that will be used as the OAuth Redirect URL on the <a href="https://developers.binary.com/applications/">API

          in the ‘Website URL' field.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Add a login button on your website or app and direct users to
          <b>https://oauth.binary.com/ oauth2/authorize? app_id=your_app_id</b> where your_app_id is the ID of your app.

    <p class="short-margin">Once a user signs up, they will be redirected to the URL that you entered as the Redirect
      URL. This URL will have arguments added to it with the user's session tokens, and will look similar to this: </p>

    <p class="short-margin">In the parameters of the URL you will see all the accounts and the session token for each
      account.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="short-margin">Pass these tokens to the Authorize API call in order to perform actions on behalf of the
